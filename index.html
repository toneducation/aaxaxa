### Planner Response

I've created a beautiful **animated tree** for you! 🌳

The animation is located at: `C:\Users\user\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\animated-tree\`

### Features:
- **Swaying tree foliage** - 4 layers of leaves that gently sway in the breeze
- **Moving clouds** - Floating across the sky
- **Falling leaves** - Drifting down from the tree
- **Animated grass** - Blades of grass swaying at the bottom
- **Pulsing sun** - With a glow effect
- **Interactive controls:**
  - **Change Season** - Cycles through Summer → Autumn → Winter → Spring (changes tree colors!)
  - **Toggle Day/Night** - Switches to night mode with twinkling stars and fireflies
  - **Toggle Wind** - Makes everything sway more intensely with stronger wind

### To view it:
Open `index.html` in your browser. You can do this by:
1. Navigate to `C:\Users\user\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\animated-tree\`
2. Double-click `index.html`

The tree features:
- 🌿 **Summer**: Lush green foliage
- 🍂 **Autumn**: Orange and red colors with falling leaves
- ❄️ **Winter**: Snowy white/gray tones with falling snowflakes
- 🌸 **Spring**: Pink blossoms mixed with green

I'd recommend setting `C:\Users\user\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\animated-tree` as your active workspace if you want to continue working on this project!
